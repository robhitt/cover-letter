      <p class="main__paragraph main__dear">Dear Hiring Manager:</p>

      <p>My name is Rob Hitt and I have worked at Curalate as a Solutions Engineer for the past 9 months building carousels,
        galleries, interstitials, and modals for some of the world's largest e-commerce and retail companies. I’m writing
        to express my great interest for the 
        <span class="main__position"></span> 
        position.
      </p>

      <p class="main__paragraph">
          At Curalate I built products directly for the homepages of: Bergdorf Goodman, Perry Ellis, Victoria’s Secret, Original Penguin, Charlotte Olympia, Topshop/Topman, and so many more.
      </p>

      <p class="main__paragraph">I make a strong candidate as I have an education in full-stack web development, coupled with veteran experience in artist management.  Managing artists the past 10 years has proven my attention to detail to be second to none!  I’ve also always loved design.  When I was younger, I played and toured in a band where I would create our website, design many of our t-shirts, and also make our album artwork.  I’ve always had a knack for problem solving and this position at 
        <span class="main__company-name"></span>
         fits my skill set perfectly.
      </p>

      <p class="main__paragraph">
          Throughout high school and college as I was a drummer in my band I would design and deploy our website, manage our mailing lists, and run our social media accounts. This led me to my decision while at Rutgers University to major in Management Science and Information Systems along with a Computer Science minor.  Immediately after college my band took off and instead of diving into a tech career we were signed to a major record label and I toured the world the following 7 years. I was playing rock shows with some of the biggest rock bands in front of thousands of people.  While on tour I remember being in Berlin, Tokyo, and Melbourne begging the show promoter to let me use their dial-up and wifi so I could update our website.
      </p>

      <p class="main__paragraph">
        After my band broke up I transitioned quickly and started managing artists.  For the following 10 years, I worked directly with Sia, Fall Out Boy, Shaggy, Big Data, and Jack’s Mannequin.  Most recently while managing the artist Big Data I oversaw a team of 10 and I led us to sell over 700,000 singles of our song “Dangerous.” After finding success as an artist manager, it was time to fulfill my lifelong dream of becoming a web/software developer.  As a result, I attended The Flatiron School’s Full Stack Web Development Program, spending 3 intensive months learning and creating apps/projects using a variety of languages and frameworks, such as Ruby, Ruby on Rails, React, Redux, Javascript, AJAX, OAuth, HTML, CSS, and so much more.
      </p>

      <p class="main__paragraph">
          Fun fact: I founded and run the Bodega Cats of Instagram account (<a href="http://www.instagram.com/bodegacatsofinstagram" class="main__link">@bodegacatsofinstagram</a>). Between the Instagram and Twitter I now have over 240,000 followers! I know that my dedicated, hard working, and fast learning characteristics would make me a beneficial asset to your team as a developer. I would welcome the chance to discuss how my technical and leadership skills would benefit
